# Statistic study of the data base



## Basic considerations

There is **any missing value** in the Database. 

There is a total of ==34551849== rows. 



## Participation 

There is ==69 distincts participants== in the study. They are randomly numeroted from 1 to 110

![Apparition_By_Id](C:\Users\louis\Desktop\Cours\STI 4A\Projet Anon\Image\Apparition_By_Id.png)

There is a huge difference in IDs distribution with the 4th ID having way more value than any other

----------------------------------------

## Time considerations 

### By days

The study [spans 70 days]() with data ==irregularly distributed== over time. 



![Entries per day](C:\Users\louis\Desktop\Cours\STI 4A\Projet Anon\Image\Entries per day.png)

It lasts exactly ==10 weeks==. [The first week is the 10th]() of 2015 and [the last one is the 20th](). 



**IDs are not uniform** neither through times. There is no day where all the 69 IDs are together and there is some days where  there is less than 20 IDs sending datas.

## Space distribution 

All data space distribution : 

![Space_distr](C:\Users\louis\Desktop\Cours\STI 4A\Projet Anon\Image\Space_distr.PNG)

Most the value are concentrated in the center of the graph (ie [-5 ; 25] lat and [35 ; 50] lon )

## Weeks 



### 1st week

| Number of Entries | Number of IDs |
| :---------------: | :-----------: |

![Week10_loc](C:\Users\louis\Desktop\Cours\STI 4A\Projet Anon\Image\Week10_loc.png)

More than 90% of the values for this weeks are in this interval (41 : 47 lon / -1 : 6 lat )

==99.99% of the value in the range  : -6 / 17 lat 40 / 51 lon (only one value missing )==

Missing value : 

```
         Unnamed: 0  ID                 date        lat        lon  week

â€‹	

The disparity in Id's data by week must absolutely be handle. By attacking with those data (% of apparitions for each id we can easily detect which Anon-Id correspond to which Id  = [frequency analysis]() ) 

IDEA : Bring the Apparitions by Ids and Week a scale function : ie regroup ID that have roughly the same magnitude (for example Week 19 we could regroup the 8 les dense IDs).
